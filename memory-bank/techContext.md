# Tech Context

The Recruiter Email Processor project leverages a range of modern technologies and tools to ensure robust functionality and efficient development. Key technologies and setups include:

- **Programming Language:**  
  Python is used as the primary programming language, with the application structured into modular components (controllers, models, services, views).

- **Web Framework:**  
  The project likely utilizes a lightweight Python web framework (such as Flask or a similar framework) to handle routing, request processing, and template rendering.

- **External Integrations:**

  - **Gmail API Integration:** For retrieving and processing recruiter emails.
  - **OpenAI API Integration:** To generate candidate resumes and perform related text processing tasks.

- **Dependency Management:**  
  Dependencies are managed through a requirements.txt file, ensuring reproducible environments.

- **Shell Scripts:**  
  Shell scripts (e.g., createRobot.sh, start_app.sh) are included to automate common tasks such as application startup and setup.

- **Directory Structure:**  
  The project is organized into subdirectories under the app/ folder, segregating controllers, models, services, views, templates, static files, and uploads. This aids in maintaining a clear separation of concerns and modular development.

- **Development Environment:**  
  The project is developed on macOS and utilizes shell scripting and Python-based tooling. The environment may also include virtual environments to manage Python dependencies.

This documentation provides an overview of the technical underpinnings of the project and serves as a reference for ongoing development and maintenance.
