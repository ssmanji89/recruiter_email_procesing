# Active Context

Current Objective: Develop enhancements for the Recruiter Email Processor project.

Enhancements to be implemented include:

- Asynchronous email processing in email_controller.py and email_model.py for improved throughput.
- Integration of additional email provider adapters alongside Gmail.
- Enhanced error handling and logging in openai_service.py, with advanced GPT function calling features.
- Implementation of a caching mechanism to avoid redundant API calls.
- UI updates in dashboard.html, profile_form.html, and results.html for dynamic content and improved usability.
- Development of a comprehensive testing suite covering unit and integration tests.
- Refactoring for improved modularity and maintainability.

Next Steps:

1. Begin code modifications to support asynchronous operations.
2. Update existing modules and create new adapters as needed.
3. Track progress updates in the progress.md file.
