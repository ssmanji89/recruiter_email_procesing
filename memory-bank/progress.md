# Progress

- Updated activeContext.md with the enhancement objectives.
- Modified app/controllers/email_controller.py to support asynchronous processing.
- Enhanced app/services/openai_service.py to support asynchronous API calls and implemented a caching mechanism for storing generated resumes.

Next Steps:

1. Continue refactoring code to support asynchronous operations in additional modules.
2. Develop integration for additional email provider adapters.
3. Update UI components (dashboard.html, profile_form.html, results.html) for improved dynamic content rendering.
4. Create a comprehensive testing suite for unit and integration tests.

Overall, the enhanced code base is now evolving towards better scalability and modularity.
