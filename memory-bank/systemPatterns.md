# System Patterns

The Recruiter Email Processor is organized following established architectural patterns to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. The key components include:

- **Controllers:**  
  Handle request routing and business logic for processing recruiter emails and managing candidate data. Controllers coordinate interactions between the view layer and backend services.

- **Models:**  
  Represent the core data structures, enabling data validation, storage, and retrieval. Models encapsulate the format and behavior of email and candidate resume data.

- **Services:**  
  Facilitate integration with external APIs and handle business operations such as:

  - Retrieving emails via Gmail.
  - Generating candidate resumes using OpenAI.
  - Any additional processing required by external systems.

- **Views:**  
  Provide a user-friendly web interface to display dashboards, profiles, and processed resume content. Views work closely with controllers to render dynamic content.

## Architectural Patterns

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller):**  
  The project leverages the MVC pattern to separate concerns, ensuring that data handling (Models), user interface (Views), and application logic (Controllers) remain distinct.

- **Service-Oriented Architecture:**  
  Services are designed as independent modules that can be updated or replaced, enhancing the flexibility of integrating new external APIs or business logic.

- **Modular Design:**  
  The project structure supports flexibility and ease-of-maintenance through clear separation into directories (controllers, models, services, views). This promotes reusability and simplifies testing.
